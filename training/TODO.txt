--------------make training data steps-----------------

0 decide how many 10km tiles we want to introduce

1 Select area by 10km tile



2 Clip stonewall dataset by tile, and clip DTM by tile
	- DTM is on R drive
	- get 10km tile name and find corresponding 1km tiles
	- make 10km tile of DTM (and DSM)



3 run python profiles script (output geojson of lines)

4 read all geojsons to a geopandas dataframe, concat and export again as new geojson

17 geojsons


---------------- ezra


4 visually check the output against orthfoto/dtm (marcia/angelina/mathilde/or us)

----------------------- ana 


5 anti-aliasing (I dont remember how we did this)




6 extracting patches in overlap for both labels (stonewalls) and the training data (dtm etc)



17 sets of labels and DTM


--------------train model model steps-----------------

either run 17 times, or put together to 1 dataset

1 Import labels (stonewalls) and training data



2 Train Model
